# K-Nearest-Neighbors-Tutorial
ðŸ“˜ This repository offers a complete K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) tutorial, guiding you from core theory to hands-on practice. Learn to implement KNN from scratch with NumPy, apply it using scikit-learn, and explore visualizations, datasets, and Jupyter notebooks to fully understand, test, and optimize the algorithm.
