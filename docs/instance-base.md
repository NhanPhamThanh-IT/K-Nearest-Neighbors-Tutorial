# Instance-Based Learning

## What is Instance-Based Learning?

Instance-based learning is a type of machine learning approach where the model memorizes the training data and makes predictions by comparing new data points directly to the stored instances. Instead of learning an explicit mapping function, the model uses the actual data points for prediction.

## Key Characteristics

- **No Explicit Model:** The algorithm does not build a general model but relies on the training data itself.
- **Lazy Learning:** Computation is deferred until a prediction is needed.
- **Similarity-Based:** Predictions are made based on the similarity (distance) between new and stored instances.

## Examples of Instance-Based Algorithms

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Some versions of Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Case-Based Reasoning

## How It Works

1. Store all training data in memory.
2. When a new input arrives, calculate its similarity (often using distance metrics) to all stored instances.
3. Use the most similar instances to make a prediction (e.g., majority vote for classification, average for regression).

## Advantages

- Simple to implement and understand.
- Can adapt to complex data distributions.

## Disadvantages

- Requires storing the entire training dataset.
- Can be slow and memory-intensive for large datasets.
- Sensitive to irrelevant or noisy features.

## When to Use Instance-Based Learning

- When the relationship between features and target is complex or unknown.
- When you have enough memory and computational resources.
