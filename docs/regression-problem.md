# Regression Problem

## What is a Regression Problem?

A regression problem is a type of supervised learning task where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value based on input features. In regression, the output variable (target) is quantitative, meaning it can take on any value within a range.

## Examples of Regression Problems

- Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.
- Estimating a person's weight from their height and age.
- Forecasting stock prices over time.
- Predicting temperature for a given day based on weather data.

## Mathematical Representation

Given input features $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$, the goal is to learn a function $f$ such that:

$$
y = f(\mathbf{x})
$$

where $y$ is a continuous value.

## Common Regression Algorithms

- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Neural Networks

## Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- $R^2$ Score (Coefficient of Determination)

## Key Points

- The target variable is continuous.
- Used in scenarios where precise numerical predictions are needed.
- Data should be preprocessed and features scaled if necessary.
