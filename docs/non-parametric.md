# Non-Parametric Models

## What is a Non-Parametric Model?

A non-parametric model is a type of machine learning model that does not assume a fixed form or number of parameters for the underlying function it is trying to learn. Instead, non-parametric models can grow in complexity as more data is provided, allowing them to adapt to the data's structure.

## Key Characteristics

- **No Fixed Number of Parameters:** The model's complexity can increase with more data.
- **Flexible:** Can model complex relationships without a predetermined equation.
- **Data-Driven:** Relies heavily on the training data for making predictions.

## Examples of Non-Parametric Models

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Kernel Density Estimation
- Support Vector Machines (with certain kernels)

## Comparison with Parametric Models

- **Parametric Models:** Assume a specific form (e.g., linear regression assumes a linear relationship) and have a fixed number of parameters.
- **Non-Parametric Models:** Do not assume a specific form and can have an unlimited number of parameters as data increases.

## Advantages

- Can fit a wide variety of data patterns.
- No need to specify a functional form in advance.

## Disadvantages

- Can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.
- May require more data to make accurate predictions.

## When to Use Non-Parametric Models

- When you do not know the underlying relationship between variables.
- When you have enough data to support flexible modeling.
