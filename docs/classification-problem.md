# Classification Problem

## What is a Classification Problem?

A classification problem is a type of supervised learning task where the goal is to predict a discrete label or category for given input features. In classification, the output variable (target) is qualitative, meaning it represents classes or categories.

## Examples of Classification Problems

- Determining if an email is spam or not spam.
- Classifying images as cats, dogs, or birds.
- Predicting whether a patient has a disease (yes/no).
- Recognizing handwritten digits (0-9).

## Mathematical Representation

Given input features $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$, the goal is to learn a function $f$ such that:

$$
y = f(\mathbf{x})
$$

where $y$ is a class label, such as $y \in \{0, 1\}$ for binary classification or $y \in \{1, 2, ..., K\}$ for multi-class classification.

## Common Classification Algorithms

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Score

## Key Points

- The target variable is categorical (discrete classes).
- Used in scenarios where the output is a label or category.
- Data preprocessing and feature selection can improve performance.
